    "\n",
    "Continuing with our library analogy, think of the key as the unique code for each book and the value as the book itself. This pairing makes it easy to locate any book in the library."

    "- **Unordered**: The order of items is not guaranteed (in Python 3.7+, insertion order is preserved).\n",
    "- **Mutable**: You can change, add, or remove items after the dictionary is created.\n",
    "- **Key-Value Pairs**: Each key is unique, and it maps to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our library analogy, the unordered nature of dictionaries is like books being stored in random shelves, but you can still find them quickly using their unique codes. The mutability is like being able to add, remove, or update books in the library."
