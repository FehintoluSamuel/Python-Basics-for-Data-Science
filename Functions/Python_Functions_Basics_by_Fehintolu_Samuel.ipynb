    "In Python, a **function** is like a **kitchen station** in a restaurant. You give it ingredients (inputs), it does some work (process), and gives you a dish (output).\n",

    "**Why use functions?**\n",
    "- To keep code organized (like keeping a clean kitchen!)\n",
    "- To reuse code easily (like having a recipe you can follow again)\n",
    "- To make your program easier to understand and maintain\n",

    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",
